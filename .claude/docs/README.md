## What this is

A reusable framework that wraps Claude Code with a disciplined pipeline:
**spec -> plan -> implement -> review -> fix -> test**

Every step is a skill — a reusable prompt that Claude executes on demand. Skills are technology-agnostic: they discover project commands from `CLAUDE.md` rather than hardcoding tools.

## Why this exists

Claude Code is powerful but context-hungry. Without structure:

- Sessions accumulate unrelated work and degrade in quality
- Reviews are biased because Claude reviews code it just wrote
- Bugs slip through because TypeScript is never type-checked separately
- Knowledge from blog posts and repos is lost between sessions

This framework solves all of these systematically.

## Quick start

```
# Ship a feature end-to-end (automated):
/ship <feature name>

# Or step-by-step (manual):
/0_spec <feature name>
/1_implement <spec name>
/clear
/2_review <spec name>
/3_fix <review name>
/test
```

## Skills overview

### Core pipeline

| Skill                                             | When to use                                                                                               |

### Knowledge and session management

| Skill                                       | When to use                                                                           |

## Lifecycle hooks

Four hooks are registered in `.claude/settings.json` to enforce quality automatically:

| Hook                 | Event               | Matcher       | What it does                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `auto-approve.js`    | `PermissionRequest` | `*`           | 3-tier auto-approve: safe tools approved, destructive patterns blocked, ambiguous passed through |
| `protect-secrets.js` | `PreToolUse`        | `Edit\|Write` | Blocks writes to sensitive files (`.env`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, credentials, etc.) via exit code 2   |
| `auto-format.js`     | `PostToolUse`       | `Edit\|Write` | Auto-formats files after edits (Prettier for JS/TS/CSS/JSON/MD, ruff for Python)                 |
| `post-compact.js`    | `PostCompact`       | (all)         | Re-injects pipeline state (active spec, review, handoff, git branch) after context compaction    |
